## Introduction
##### In this project, we investigate traffic collisions in New York City using detailed crash data collected by the NYPD. We will explore trends over time, examine regional patterns, and analyze the main contributing factors behind traffic accidents. We also examine how the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced traffic patterns and collision rates. Our goal is to better understand where and why accidents happen, and how traffic safety has changed over time.

## Collisions per year

##### The histogram shows the number of traffic collisions per year in New York City from 2013 to 2024. We see a steady increase in collisions from 2013, peaking in 2015 with over 85,000 reported incidents. After 2015, the number of collisions remained relatively stable until 2019, before dropping sharply in 2020. This decline coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, where lockdowns and reduced traffic likely led to fewer accidents. Since 2020, the number of collisions has remained lower compared to pre-pandemic years, with a slight downward trend continuing through 2024.

## Injuries and fatalities per year

##### The first plot shows the number of people injured in traffic collisions each year from 2013 to 2024. Similar to the trend in total collisions, injuries generally increased from 2013 until 2018, reaching a peak of over 22,000 injuries. After 2019, there was a noticeable decline, again corresponding with the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced traffic volumes. However, injury numbers have been rising slightly again since 2021, though they have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.

##### The second plot shows the number of fatalities resulting from traffic collisions over the same period. Unlike injuries, the number of fatalities remained relatively stable across the years, fluctuating between 67 and 123 deaths annually. Interestingly, while the number of collisions and injuries dropped sharply in 2020, fatalities did not decrease as much â€” and even remained high compared to earlier years. This may suggest that although there were fewer collisions during the pandemic, the collisions that did occur were often more severe.
